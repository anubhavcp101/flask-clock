White Spaces in Jinja2 
========================
You can also strip whitespace in templates by hand. If you add a minus sign (-) to the start or end of a block (e.g. a For tag), a comment, or a variable expression, the whitespaces before or after that block will be removed:

{% for item in seq -%}
    {{ item }}
{%- endfor %}
This will yield all elements without whitespace between them. If seq was a list of numbers from 1 to 9, the output would be 123456789.

If Line Statements are enabled, they strip leading whitespace automatically up to the beginning of the line.

By default, Jinja also removes trailing newlines. To keep single trailing newlines, configure Jinja to keep_trailing_newline.

Note
You must not add whitespace between the tag and the minus sign.

valid:

{%- if foo -%}...{% endif %}
invalid:

{% - if foo - %}...{% endif %}
